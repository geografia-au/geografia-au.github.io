      <title>Are your maps meaningless to 8% of your audience?</title>

      <description>Humans are innately visual creatures. If you want confirmation of this in our industry, see what happens next time youâ€™re in a long, exhausting meeting. As soon as someone pulls out a map or an image of some sort, people perk up. Conversations become more animated and decisions are made.&amp;nbsp;
We love photos, images, maps and, at a pinch, charts. Its why graphics are significantly more effective (and increasingly popular) at communicating information than large tables of data.</description>

      <description>If we accept that our economy is complex and never in equilibrium, then we need to keep an eye out for both small and large changes in it. You can never tell which one&amp;nbsp;might become a defining influence on what our job landscape and our cities look like. In the case of automation, a lot has been written on it already. We&amp;rsquo;ve been going through waves of job automation for at least a few centuries now, although the one we&amp;rsquo;re at the beginning of just might be one of the fastest we&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced.</description>

      <description>Matt and Kevin&amp;nbsp;attended the 2015 New Cities Summit in Jakarta. This is a biennial conference run by the New Cities Foundation and its&amp;nbsp;all about lifting the game in city design, planning and management. They attended some interesting sessions and talked to people working around the world&amp;nbsp;on innovative, and often low cost, ways of making cities more efficient and liveable. Some of the things taken from the conference were:&amp;nbsp;
As if&amp;nbsp;you didn&amp;rsquo;t know it by now, its pretty apparent that most of the world&amp;rsquo;s economic dynamism can be found in the rapidly growing cities of the world.</description>

      <description>A statistical and GIS-based analysis of school demand to identify the optimum site for a new school in Moreton Bay on behalf of Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE). It uses&amp;nbsp;real enrolment data, analysing trends over time to develop a probabilistic model of the growth rates for new catchment areas. This factors in travel patterns and &amp;lsquo;attractiveness&amp;rsquo; features to identify the better of two locations for a new school in the rapidly growing region.</description>

      <description>Our recent study for Southern Melbourne RDA looked into the economic benefits of the NBN and included a survey of over 300 businesses in the region.&amp;nbsp;These businesses were in precincts that were not included in the current NBN rollout plan.&amp;nbsp;
The survey examined the quality of the current Internet access in the precincts; the effect this was having on business productivity and growth; and the expected benefits that high speed broadband (HSB â€“ in this case, the NBN) would bring to their business.</description>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/blog/2015/03/11/some_job_clusters_are_easier_to_grow/</guid>
      <description>Normal job distribution around our capital cities shows extreme concentrations in the city centres, with an outward&amp;nbsp;spread of clusters usually located around major infrastructure (e.g. roads, hospitals, industrial areas). Encouraging the growth of jobs in some of the outlying clusters is an important strategic planning objective as it can improve job accessibility for outer suburban residents and spread the transport load around the city.
A considerable amount is known about&amp;nbsp;how these clusters emerge; whether there are underlying patterns to their formation; and how much&amp;nbsp;influence can be applied to these patterns.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s pleasing to see the Intergenerational Report focusing on long-term demographic trends and their implications for Australia. It reminds us that international migration has been, and is likely to continue to be, a major factor for change, influencing the pace and the makeup of growth in our communities.
With Advanced Demographic Modelling, weâ€™ve been examining what alternative long-term migration scenarios might mean for different municipalities. Obviously, the scale of net overseas migration has been the key reason some areas have grown rapidly, and it needs to be part of the strategic thinking by councils wishing to address population decline.</description>

      <description>In partnership with the Orbost community, we have developed a plan for the economic revitalisation of Orbost and surrounds. The plan addresses the effect of industry changes, particularly forestry, and the declining population. It includes business cases for key revitalisation initiatives, such as&amp;nbsp;Orbost as an aged friendly town, tourism opportunities and agribusiness&amp;nbsp;and is based on substantial community input.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>The Greater Bunbury area (150km south of Perth) has a population of 75,000 and is forecast to grow to 100,000 by 2031 and 150,000 by 2050. A review of land supply by the State planning authority concluded that demand could be satisfied through a combination of an urban infill program and the release of over 2,000ha of land for Greenfield development. At first glance this seemed plausible. However, a closer examination revealed some fundamental flaws in the underlying assumptions that would have resulted in a land shortage of between 300 and 1,000ha.</description>

      <description>Liveability, spatial efficiency and the knowledge economy are important to Melbourneâ€™s economic future and the way they are related to one another makes them relevant subject matter for strategic metropolitan planning. This is particularly so for transport infrastructure priorities and whether liveability near knowledge job clusters should be a metropolitan-wide concern. Updating some work done for Melbourneâ€™s 2012 Knowledge Cities conference has revealed some â€˜low hanging fruitâ€™ in the spatial distribution of the knowledge sector that may help shed light on the options for a more liveable and efficient city.</description>

      <description>As part of a review of the population growth assumptions underpinning the Greater Bunbury Strategy, we deployed our housing and population capacity model to estimate the land required to accommodate expected population growth in the Greater Bunbury Region. We found that the increase in density was likely&amp;nbsp;be slower than expected and that this would result in a&amp;nbsp;shortfall of up to 700ha of residential land by build out.&amp;nbsp;
As with all forecasting we do, we used a probabilistic model to account for the uncertainty in the population growth and other key factors such as household size, dwelling choice,&amp;nbsp;vacancy rates and rate of construction.</description>

      <description>In northern Tasmania, the population is growing slowly, but ageing rapidly. While the housing supply pipeline appears to be more than adequate to meet the modest demand, the rapid ageing of the population means that the type of current and planned housing stock is increasingly unsuited to the population, who are living in smaller households, consequently, seeking smaller houses and lots. The counter-intuitive result is that, although, at best, the population may grow by 25% (from around 150,000 to 180,000).</description>

      <description>There are many interacting factors that influence the choice an individual makes when deciding where to shop and recreate. Understanding this requires a suitably sophisticated approach based on good evidence. Extensive consultation, including consumer surveys, provided us with data we could use to quantify the relative importance of activation, amenity and retail choice when it comes to where they would shop in the Greater Shepparton area. From this we identified the most cost-effective way to increase visitor numbers to Sheppartonâ€™s Maude Street Mall.</description>

      <description>The school demand model we developed&amp;nbsp;represents a step change in the way future demand for schools can be predicted. At its heart is a powerful statistical technique called kernel density estimation linked to a GIS-based â€˜school supply modelâ€™. This decision-support tool delivers a reliable estimate of government, catholic and independent primary and secondary school demand. It considers location, ethnicity, income, household size and other demographic characteristics of the catchment area. Broader effects such as underlying school preference and government education policy shifts are also included.</description>

      <description>The Macedon Ranges Agribusiness Plan recognises that agribusiness is, and will continue to be, an important part of the Shire&amp;rsquo;s economy, but that land use pressures mean the Shire needs to take a more active role in minimising conflict. At the end of the project, Geografia was employed to analyse the Shire&amp;rsquo;s business survey and an extensive survey regarding telecommunications blackspots in the region.

      <description>Produced ahead of schedule, and in partnership with regular consulting economist Tim Nott, the background report and draft strategy involved extensive modelling, consultation exercises and an online survey. Our work has given us an up-to-date and thorough understanding of economic, major project and development issues in the G21 region.

      <title>Greater Launceston Plan</title>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-launceston-plan/</guid>
      <description>We completed three of the seven components of the Liveable Cities&amp;rsquo; Greater Launceston Plan (a 20 year part Commonwealth-funded land use plan). First off was the community statement; a thorough documentation of community profiles across the six municipalities that made up the region.
Part two - the resource analysis - included population, housing and employment modelling designed to map out different growth scenarios and land use suitability. This included the range of probable growth, employment and housing trends into the modelling.</description>

      <description>Working with Melbourne firm, Essential Economics, we undertook a study into the economic conditions and prospects for the 25 councils that make up the National Growth Areas Alliance. Geografia developed a jobs and skills deficit measure that plotted each council according to whether their priority concerns were a lack of jobs, skills or both. The current trajectory for each council was also plotted. A strategy for intervention was prepared. Its foundation was the creation of skills ecosystems that would target 20,000 more jobs in two years.</description>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/lindenow-agricultural-intensification-cost-benefit-analysis/</guid>
      <description>Our land use optimisation model was used to predict land use change in response to greater water security in the Lindenow Valley in East Gippsland. This model identifies the thresholds at which land can be turned over to commercial crops. Improved water security then becomes the catalyst for investment, an increase in employment and, subsequently, local population. The module factors in rainfall, water availability and other production costs and outputs are farm gate sales, regional multipliers, the impact on population growth and likely demand for essential services.</description>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/stockman-mine-economic-impact-study/</guid>
      <description>We introduced the concept of systems modelling to local economic issues by developing a model that would measure the benefits of different development scenarios around the Stockman mine site in the Tambo Valley. The modelâ€™s results (and report) were used by the Shire to negotiate community development contributions from the company. The systems approach to modelling was used to construct a community decision support tool for the Shire. This was used at a highly successful community workshop focusing on how best to replace the Raymond Island Ferry service.</description>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/shepparton-rail-economic-impact-study/</guid>
      <description>One of the first times&amp;nbsp;Geografia used a systems analysis approach to assist in regional economic planning, we developed a model to&amp;nbsp;measure the economic impact of improved passenger rail services to Shepparton. The work was based on a large-scale survey of regional residents which allowed us to value the benefits of being able to regularly commute to and from Melbourne. It highlighted the flow-on benefits of better passenger rail services linking incremental improvements to increase in passenger numbers by type of journey.</description>
