      <title>Greater Bunbury Population and Housing Capacity Review</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-population-and-housing-capacity-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 23:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-population-and-housing-capacity-review/</guid>
      <description>As part of a review of the population growth assumptions underpinning the Greater Bunbury Strategy, we deployed our housing and population capacity model to estimate the land required to accommodate expected population growth in the Greater Bunbury Region. We found that the increase in density was likely&amp;nbsp;be slower than expected and that this would result in a&amp;nbsp;shortfall of up to 700ha of residential land by build out.&amp;nbsp;
As with all forecasting we do, we used a probabilistic model to account for the uncertainty in the population growth and other key factors such as household size, dwelling choice,&amp;nbsp;vacancy rates and rate of construction.</description>

      <description>The Malaysian Federal Government, through Think City commissioned Geografia to research and prepare a spatial strategy for Northern Malaysia. Encompassing land use planning, economic and demographic analysis, we prepared a 20 point plan for making strategic land use planning decisions that would assist with national development goals. The first plan was prepared in 2009 and we updated it in 2014. Amongst other things, we examined and modelled economic development opportunities in manufacturing, agribusiness, tourism, hi tech R&amp;amp;D and services.</description>

      <title>Modelling School Demand</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/estimating-school-enrolment-demands/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 23:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/estimating-school-enrolment-demands/</guid>
      <description>The school demand model we developed&amp;nbsp;represents a step change in the way future demand for schools can be predicted. At its heart is a powerful statistical technique called kernel density estimation linked to a GIS-based â€˜school supply modelâ€™. This decision-support tool delivers a reliable estimate of government, catholic and independent primary and secondary school demand. It considers location, ethnicity, income, household size and other demographic characteristics of the catchment area. Broader effects such as underlying school preference and government education policy shifts are also included.</description>
