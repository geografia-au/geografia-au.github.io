      <description>&lt;p&gt;Together with regular collaborator, Tim Nott, we investigated how to leverage from existing knowledge-based industries and supply chain components in eastern metropolitan Melbourne. The work formed part of a wider strategy designed to increase jobs in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maddington Kenwick Education and Training Services Profile</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/maddington-kenwick-education-and-training-services-profile/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study made recommendations for improvements to the focus and delivery of education related support programs for the region. The gap analysis was enhanced with a 10-year industry level labour market demand scenario model. GIS was used to map accessibility to education facilities for a community that was significantly transport disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Greater Bunbury Global and Regional Futures</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-global-and-regional-futures/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-global-and-regional-futures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An assessment of global, national and regional economic and demographic&amp;nbsp;trends and how they are affecting economic development prospects in Greater Bunbury. The work is part of the State&amp;rsquo;s Regional Centres Development Plan project for eight regional cities. Three key industries are likely to bring in new residents and investment over the next few decades: agribusiness, specialised manufacturing; and tourism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Site Optimisation in Greater Brisbane</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the work in Moreton Bay, we further developed the school demand forecasting technique to determine whether a proposed new school site would minimise school catchment area overlaps in a region with a rapidly growing population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Demand Forecasting in Moreton Bay</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 02:49:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A statistical and GIS-based analysis of school demand to identify the optimum site for a new school in Moreton Bay on behalf of Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE). It uses&amp;nbsp;real enrolment data, analysing trends over time to develop a probabilistic model of the growth rates for new catchment areas. This factors in travel patterns and &amp;lsquo;attractiveness&amp;rsquo; features to identify the better of two locations for a new school in the rapidly growing region. We then adapted and applied the model to assist BCE in determining the viability of a new primary/secondary school in a neighbouring region, factoring in the existing school provision, population growth and the likelihood that the new school would attract a sufficient number of new enrollees to warrant the investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/murchison-plan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A resource analysis and community statement leading to a regional development framework for the five councils that make up north and western Tasmania. The work included an extensive land suitability assessment and collaboration with environmental and transport&amp;nbsp;planners and community engagement specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>East Arnhem Land Economic Review</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/east-arnhem-land-economic-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 04:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/east-arnhem-land-economic-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a study mapping and analysing the scale and type of employment growth potential for Galiwink&amp;rsquo;u, East Arnhem Land. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Population estimates, infrastructure capacity and an assessment of industry growth trends (notably in tourism and agribusiness), and other factors (e.g. job automation and centralisation) have been used to prepare scenarios for economic growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Greater Bunbury Population Analysis</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-population-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2015 01:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-population-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with demographer Tom Wilson, we undertook an evaluation of the State population forecasts and the merits of using an alternative approach for Greater Bunbury. Using an&amp;nbsp;employment-based projection method is a more reliable way to calculate population in rapidly growing areas that are highly sensitive to economic conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Court Service Demand Modelling</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/court-demand-modelling-across-victoria/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2015 00:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/court-demand-modelling-across-victoria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A multi-jurisdictional service demand model to estimate future court activity across 50 regions around Victoria. It uses probabilistic (Monte Carlo) modelling to factor in uncertainty around demand, demographic, technology and policy changes and informs GHD&amp;rsquo;s service plan for Court Services Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melbourne Population &amp; Economic Projections and Profile</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/melbourne-population-economic-projections-and-profile/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 03:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/melbourne-population-economic-projections-and-profile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Geografia provides both demographic and economic projections and profiling for the City of Melbourne. We employ what is referred to as a Monte Carlo modelling technique to calculate ranged estimates for the City’s population by suburb to 2036. Both the population and economic figures are on websites custom designed by Geografia for the City. We work with leading Australian demographer, Dr Tom Wilson to ensure the figures are based on the latest, most reliable projection methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/latrobe-city-population-and-economic-indicators/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working with Latrobe City, we have developed and maintained an economic and population indicators document. It helps residents, investors and government to understand the trends that are shaping the City&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;wysiwyg-color-silver&#34;&gt;Image: Latrobe City (Geografia, 2015)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Victorian Small Towns Study</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/victorian-small-towns-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 03:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/victorian-small-towns-study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with Melbourne firm Planisphere, the study examined 31 Victorian towns, all with fewer than a thousand residents, and explored their changing nature and the contributions they make in regional Victoria. As part of the case studies, we undertook economic and demographic modelling, geographic information system (GIS) and consultation. The project outcomes supported the State Government’s regional growth plans.&lt;/p&gt;
