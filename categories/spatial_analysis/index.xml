      <title>School Site Optimisation in Greater Brisbane</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the work in Moreton Bay, we further developed the school demand forecasting technique to determine whether a proposed new school site would minimise school catchment area overlaps in a region with a rapidly growing population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Demand Forecasting in Moreton Bay</title>
      <link>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 02:49:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A statistical and GIS-based analysis of school demand to identify the optimum site for a new school in Moreton Bay on behalf of Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE). It uses&amp;nbsp;real enrolment data, analysing trends over time to develop a probabilistic model of the growth rates for new catchment areas. This factors in travel patterns and &amp;lsquo;attractiveness&amp;rsquo; features to identify the better of two locations for a new school in the rapidly growing region. We then adapted and applied the model to assist BCE in determining the viability of a new primary/secondary school in a neighbouring region, factoring in the existing school provision, population growth and the likelihood that the new school would attract a sufficient number of new enrollees to warrant the investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/court-demand-modelling-across-victoria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A multi-jurisdictional service demand model to estimate future court activity across 50 regions around Victoria. It uses probabilistic (Monte Carlo) modelling to factor in uncertainty around demand, demographic, technology and policy changes and informs GHD&amp;rsquo;s service plan for Court Services Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/victorian-small-towns-study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with Melbourne firm Planisphere, the study examined 31 Victorian towns, all with fewer than a thousand residents, and explored their changing nature and the contributions they make in regional Victoria. As part of the case studies, we undertook economic and demographic modelling, geographic information system (GIS) and consultation. The project outcomes supported the State Government’s regional growth plans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A study to measure the economic benefits of redirecting the NBN rollout in Melbourne’s South East to prioritise three key industrial precincts. It involved a survey of business operators, along with an economic and GIS analysis to develop a statement of quantitative benefit of the merits of changing the rollout plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/wanneroo-land-use-vision/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 50 year strategic vision to guide the City onto a more sustainable pathway. After detailed demographic and economic analysis we worked with the City and residents to prepare a strategic plan for land development, transport and community infrastruture planning that would help the City move closer towards the City envisaged its residents and businesses. After its conclusion, we went on to undertake a public open space study and several smaller projects investigating the options for the redevelopment of specific Council facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
