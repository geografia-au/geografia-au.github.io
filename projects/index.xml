      <guid>http://geografia.com.au/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the work in Moreton Bay, we further developed the school demand forecasting technique to determine whether a proposed new school site would minimise school catchment area overlaps in a region with a rapidly growing population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Demand Forecasting in Moreton Bay</title>
      <link>http://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</link>

      <guid>http://geografia.com.au/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A statistical and GIS-based analysis of school demand to identify the optimum site for a new school in Moreton Bay on behalf of Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE). It uses&amp;nbsp;real enrolment data, analysing trends over time to develop a probabilistic model of the growth rates for new catchment areas. This factors in travel patterns and &amp;lsquo;attractiveness&amp;rsquo; features to identify the better of two locations for a new school in the rapidly growing region. We then adapted and applied the model to assist BCE in determining the viability of a new primary/secondary school in a neighbouring region, factoring in the existing school provision, population growth and the likelihood that the new school would attract a sufficient number of new enrollees to warrant the investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
