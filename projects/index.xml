      <description>Working with econometrician, Dr Grant Coble-Neal, we developed a vector autoregressive model (VAR) to test the effects of mining industry boom bust cycles on Western Australia&amp;rsquo;s employment and economic output by region over a 10 year period. It revealed a more volatile growth trajectory than measured by the existing CGE model. These forecasts were used by the Department of Education and Training to guide their analysis of the State&amp;rsquo;s economic prospects.</description>

      <description>A 50 year strategic vision to guide the City onto a more sustainable pathway. After detailed demographic and economic analysis we worked with the City and residents to prepare a strategic plan for land development, transport and community infrastruture planning that would help the City move closer towards the City envisaged its residents and businesses. After its conclusion, we went on to undertake a public open space study and several smaller projects investigating the options for the redevelopment of specific Council facilities.</description>

      <description>A detailed study of community and economic development needs in Karratha. Consulting with business and residents and mapping out a detailed plan for community infrastructure priorities. Following on from this we prepared an economic prospectus for Roebourne and undertook a cost benefit analysis of infrastructure plans. We also ran several land use and community satisfaction surveys on behalf of the Shire.

      <description>A study mapping and analysing the potential scale and nature of employment growth in the Brimbank National Employment Cluster. It involved extensive economic modelling and GIS analysis to determine three likely growth scenarios for the Cluster and the net employment gain that the Cluster could accommodate as it expands.&amp;nbsp;
We incorporated uncertainty into the modelling by composing probability ranges for key decisions (e.g. to invest in new transport infrastructure) and processes (e.</description>

      <guid>https://geografia.com.au/projects/greater-bunbury-population-and-housing-capacity-review/</guid>
      <description>As part of a review of the population growth assumptions underpinning the Greater Bunbury Strategy, we deployed our housing and population capacity model to estimate the land required to accommodate expected population growth in the Greater Bunbury Region. We found that the increase in density was likely&amp;nbsp;be slower than expected and that this would result in a&amp;nbsp;shortfall of up to 700ha of residential land by build out.&amp;nbsp;
As with all forecasting we do, we used a probabilistic model to account for the uncertainty in the population growth and other key factors such as household size, dwelling choice,&amp;nbsp;vacancy rates and rate of construction.</description>

We identified a cluster of NFPs that were contributing more than $10 million dollars per annum to the local economy. A set of recommendations were developed that will assist the sector secure its presence in the area as an important economic and social contributor.

      <description>Accurately documenting the size and value of&amp;nbsp;manufacturing in a particular region is both difficult and useful. In south east Melbourne we found its 71,300 workers generated almost $7.9 billion in GRP. This is 24% of the State&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing value and almost 7% of national manufacturing GDP. &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>The Malaysian Federal Government, through Think City commissioned Geografia to research and prepare a spatial strategy for Northern Malaysia. Encompassing land use planning, economic and demographic analysis, we prepared a 20 point plan for making strategic land use planning decisions that would assist with national development goals. The first plan was prepared in 2009 and we updated it in 2014. Amongst other things, we examined and modelled economic development opportunities in manufacturing, agribusiness, tourism, hi tech R&amp;amp;D and services.</description>

      <description>Landcorp, the Shire of Broome and the Kimberley Development Commission worked with Geografia to profile and investigate the Shire&amp;rsquo;s economic state of play&amp;nbsp;and its prospects for growth in light of global and regional conditions.&amp;nbsp;To ensure Broome becomes&amp;nbsp;the region&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;supertown&amp;rsquo; required strategic decision-making informed by&amp;nbsp;consultation, data analysis, population and economic forecasting. This charted a trajectory for Broome that would balance mining services, tourism and agribusiness.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>The school demand model we developed&amp;nbsp;represents a step change in the way future demand for schools can be predicted. At its heart is a powerful statistical technique called kernel density estimation linked to a GIS-based ‘school supply model’. This decision-support tool delivers a reliable estimate of government, catholic and independent primary and secondary school demand. It considers location, ethnicity, income, household size and other demographic characteristics of the catchment area. Broader effects such as underlying school preference and government education policy shifts are also included.</description>

      <description>The Macedon Ranges Agribusiness Plan recognises that agribusiness is, and will continue to be, an important part of the Shire&amp;rsquo;s economy, but that land use pressures mean the Shire needs to take a more active role in minimising conflict. At the end of the project, Geografia was employed to analyse the Shire&amp;rsquo;s business survey and an extensive survey regarding telecommunications blackspots in the region.

      <description>We completed three of the seven components of the Liveable Cities&amp;rsquo; Greater Launceston Plan (a 20 year part Commonwealth-funded land use plan). First off was the community statement; a thorough documentation of community profiles across the six municipalities that made up the region.
Part two - the resource analysis - included population, housing and employment modelling designed to map out different growth scenarios and land use suitability. This included the range of probable growth, employment and housing trends into the modelling.</description>

      <description>Working with Melbourne firm, Essential Economics, we undertook a study into the economic conditions and prospects for the 25 councils that make up the National Growth Areas Alliance. Geografia developed a jobs and skills deficit measure that plotted each council according to whether their priority concerns were a lack of jobs, skills or both. The current trajectory for each council was also plotted. A strategy for intervention was prepared. Its foundation was the creation of skills ecosystems that would target 20,000 more jobs in two years.</description>

      <description>Our land use optimisation model was used to predict land use change in response to greater water security in the Lindenow Valley in East Gippsland. This model identifies the thresholds at which land can be turned over to commercial crops. Improved water security then becomes the catalyst for investment, an increase in employment and, subsequently, local population. The module factors in rainfall, water availability and other production costs and outputs are farm gate sales, regional multipliers, the impact on population growth and likely demand for essential services.</description>

      <description>We introduced the concept of systems modelling to local economic issues by developing a model that would measure the benefits of different development scenarios around the Stockman mine site in the Tambo Valley. The model’s results (and report) were used by the Shire to negotiate community development contributions from the company. The systems approach to modelling was used to construct a community decision support tool for the Shire. This was used at a highly successful community workshop focusing on how best to replace the Raymond Island Ferry service.</description>

      <description>One of the first times&amp;nbsp;Geografia used a systems analysis approach to assist in regional economic planning, we developed a model to&amp;nbsp;measure the economic impact of improved passenger rail services to Shepparton. The work was based on a large-scale survey of regional residents which allowed us to value the benefits of being able to regularly commute to and from Melbourne. It highlighted the flow-on benefits of better passenger rail services linking incremental improvements to increase in passenger numbers by type of journey.</description>
