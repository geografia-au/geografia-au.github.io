  - title: Decision support
    desc: We work with clients to develop mobile and web-based decision support tools and expert systems to help them be more effective decision-makers. These tools integrate both qualitative and quantitative dimensions to the decision making. The City of Melbourne's Land Use and Infrastructure Model (LUIM) is a recent example.

  - title: Interactive atlases
    desc: We develop online atlases to help visualise and communicate the results of modelling and analysis. Spatial economic data is dynamic and deep. Rather than presenting this in static maps and tables, we prefer to compile interactive, online atlases for clients to explore and understand their economies in as much detail as they wish. Our seniors housing land suitability app is one example.
