    <p>Humans are innately visual creatures. If you want confirmation of this in our industry, see what happens next time you’re in a long, exhausting meeting. As soon as someone pulls out a map or an image of some sort, people perk up. Conversations become more animated and decisions are made.&nbsp; We love photos, images, maps and, at a pinch, charts. Its why graphics are significantly more effective (and increasingly popular) at communicating information than large tables of data.</p>

    <p>If we accept that our economy is complex and never in equilibrium, then we need to keep an eye out for both small and large changes in it. You can never tell which one&nbsp;might become a defining influence on what our job landscape and our cities look like. In the case of automation, a lot has been written on it already. We&rsquo;ve been going through waves of job automation for at least a few centuries now, although the one we&rsquo;re at the beginning of just might be one of the fastest we&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>

    <p>Our recent study for Southern Melbourne RDA looked into the economic benefits of the NBN and included a survey of over 300 businesses in the region.&nbsp;These businesses were in precincts that were not included in the current NBN rollout plan.&nbsp; The survey examined the quality of the current Internet access in the precincts; the effect this was having on business productivity and growth; and the expected benefits that high speed broadband (HSB – in this case, the NBN) would bring to their business.&nbsp; Amongst many results, the study found that HSB was expected to deliver increased productivity, expansion into new manufacturing and even the reshoring of more traditional manufacturing.</p>

    <p>As advocates of open data initiatives, we're pleased to discover three freshly released data sets available to planners and economists seeking to understand Victoria's cities. Gaining access to these data sets is hugely important for planning and managing cities. Congratulations to the government departments responsible for compiling and releasing these important data sets - the open data movement is gaining momentum! 1.

    <h3><a href="/blog/2015/03/11/some_job_clusters_are_easier_to_grow/">Some job clusters are easier to grow</a></h3>
    <p>Normal job distribution around our capital cities shows extreme concentrations in the city centres, with an outward&nbsp;spread of clusters usually located around major infrastructure (e.g. roads, hospitals, industrial areas). Encouraging the growth of jobs in some of the outlying clusters is an important strategic planning objective as it can improve job accessibility for outer suburban residents and spread the transport load around the city. A considerable amount is known about&nbsp;how these clusters emerge; whether there are underlying patterns to their formation; and how much&nbsp;influence can be applied to these patterns.</p>

    <p>It’s pleasing to see the Intergenerational Report focusing on long-term demographic trends and their implications for Australia. It reminds us that international migration has been, and is likely to continue to be, a major factor for change, influencing the pace and the makeup of growth in our communities. With Advanced Demographic Modelling, we’ve been examining what alternative long-term migration scenarios might mean for different municipalities. Obviously, the scale of net overseas migration has been the key reason some areas have grown rapidly, and it needs to be part of the strategic thinking by councils wishing to address population decline.</p>

    <p>The Greater Bunbury area (150km south of Perth) has a population of 75,000 and is forecast to grow to 100,000 by 2031 and 150,000 by 2050. A review of land supply by the State planning authority concluded that demand could be satisfied through a combination of an urban infill program and the release of over 2,000ha of land for Greenfield development. At first glance this seemed plausible. However, a closer examination revealed some fundamental flaws in the underlying assumptions that would have resulted in a land shortage of between 300 and 1,000ha.&nbsp; The State Government’s population and housing capacity assumptions included the claims that every dwelling will be occupied by 2.5 people; that dwellings will always be 100% occupied; and that there will be no holiday homes or short term accommodation in the region.</p>

    <p>Liveability, spatial efficiency and the knowledge economy are important to Melbourne’s economic future and the way they are related to one another makes them relevant subject matter for strategic metropolitan planning. This is particularly so for transport infrastructure priorities and whether liveability near knowledge job clusters should be a metropolitan-wide concern. Updating some work done for Melbourne’s 2012 Knowledge Cities conference has revealed some ‘low hanging fruit’ in the spatial distribution of the knowledge sector that may help shed light on the options for a more liveable and efficient city.&nbsp; What is the Knowledge Economy?There are many different ways to classify the knowledge economy, but the most meaningful considers both the industry sector and a worker’s occupation.</p>
